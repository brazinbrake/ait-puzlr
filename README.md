C# Program using BFS to find solution to 8 puzzle problem (tutorial)

My first program in C# and first time using BFS

Followed tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6edibwHBDFk and added 
comments and slight variations as necessary per ease of my understanding. 
If you follow the tutorial, I recommend going through the logic for the moves
on your own and copy/pasting the whole section after you get the "moveRight" done.

You should be able to change the test puzzle scenario to any given set of 9 ints
and it will show the solution at the end and trace all the way back to the puzzle
scenario you provide.
